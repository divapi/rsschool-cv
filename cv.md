## Summary: 

**My goal is to learn everything new and interesting. I love programming. I like to spend a lot of time doing things that interest me. In order to get a promising job with a decent salary in the future.**

_At the moment I don’t have any skills and experience, in fact, for this purpose I came to you._ 

## _Work experience:_ 
_There are no graduation courses. But at the same time as your courses I also go to [Step Academy](https://itstep.by/)_
